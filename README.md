# Project "Algorithms and Programming for Beginners: Preparing New Talents in the Language of Computing Technologies".

This project was planned, proposed, and carried by me along with two undergrad students working under my supervision. The project aimed at Brazilian high-school level students that wished to learn how to program. The project focused on developing their algorithmic thinking - rather than just learning a programming language in the traditional way.

The project encompassed playful activities such as handcrafting bracelets with the student's initials in binary ASCII representation, cardboard games, problem-solving challenges, team challenges on computing knowledge and even the programing of a time-capsule, where the students hard-coded messages with their own forescasts to the next 10 years.

The project also stimulated the application and participation of women and the LGBTQIA+ audience to promote their inclusion and empowerment in the Brazilian tech field.
