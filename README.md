This project was planned, proposed, and carried by me and two undergrad students working under my supervision. The project aimed at Brazilian high-school level students that wished to learn how to program. The project focused on developing their algorithmic thinking - rather than just learning a programming language in the traditional way.
</p>
  
<p>
The project encompassed playful activities such as handcrafting bracelets with the student's initials in binary ASCII representation, cardboard games, problem-solving challenges, team challenges mixed with programming, and even the coding of a time-capsule, where the students hard-coded messages with their own forecasts to the next 10 years.
</p>

The participation of the interns under my supervision was invaluable to the project's success. They helped me in different activities such as crafting the games and prizes; helping me organize and coordinate the in-class and outdoor activities with the students; helping the students with coding questions etc.
</p>
  
<p>
The project also stimulated the application and participation of women and the LGBTQIA+ audience to promote their inclusion and empowerment in the Brazilian tech field.
